Scenes with the animals are great, so was the voice acting, namely James Earl and Seth Rogen to name a few. And also very well directed by Jon Favreau, who also directed The Jungle Book. If you loved the original 1994 film, then give this film a look, you might like it.
Hideous colors, unexpressive faces, endless sandbagging, and ironically comedic singing and voice acting. Disney is really going down the drain.
This is a poor attempt at a lie action film of a classic cartoon. The only good characters in it are pumba and i thought John oliver was going to be the worst character voice in it,how wrong was i. There were too many moments of nothingness. The Voices and music sucked as did direction of well known story, i did like the monkey (mandrill) Rafiki. The Mandrill should have been glue holding it all together telling a story of lion king. voice of pumba too squeaky even adult actors voice sucked.
As if a 14 year old has been let loose with alot of money and fine cast and cameras. I was genuinely looking forward to a bit of escapist action but this is just plain nonsense which is laugh out loud bad funny.
